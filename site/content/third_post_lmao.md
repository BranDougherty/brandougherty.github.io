Talking about stuff.
And more stuff. Look an edit! Another edit! Wow another!

```javascript bash
function lmao() {
    console.log("xd", 3);
}

function alrightyThen() {
    console.log("DLFIJ");
}

exports.lmao = lmao;
exports.alrightyThen = alrightyThen;
```

Wow, great code idiot.

Let's talk about `function lmao();` as an inline code sample, and also `lmao();`.

```cpp
template<typename T>
int getTheInt(T &&t_rvalue) {
  return t_rvalue.hashcode() + "";
}
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "lmao"
myvar=3
echo "$myvar"
```

```clojure
(defn myfn
  [arg1 arg2]
  (let [score-ele (.getElementById js/document "total-score")]
    (get-score score-ele)))
```

And to wrap things up, the industrial revolution has been a disaster for the human race.
